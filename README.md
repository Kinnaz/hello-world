Hi! I'm Max,
I am 21 years old & am studying at Feduni in a  Bachelor of Information Technology (Professional Practice). I am living on Res & I very much enjoy it.  I am originally from Melbourne and moved to Ballarat to pursue an internship with IBM and am very happy I made that decision.  It has been very enjoyable despite multiple lockdowns over the past year and a half.
